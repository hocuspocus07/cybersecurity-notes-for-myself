->HYPERVISER:
Virtualization uses hypervisors to manage the relationship between physical and virtual resources.
A hypervisor is the abstraction layer that sits between the physical computer and the VM.
Abstraction is what separates hardware from software.
there are two types of hypervisers:
1. type 1, or bare metal:
Type one hypervisors interact with the operating system’s components directly.
It replaces the entire operating system of the underlying computer.
2. type 2, or hosted:
use the computer’s existing operating system and runs as an application over the operating system.

->ADVANTAGES:
1. portability
2. scalability
3. testing environment
