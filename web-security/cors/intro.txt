CORS is an extension of SOP(same origin policy), it also adds flexibility to it. It is a system that enables controlled access to the resources outside of the website in a safe and controlled way. It also provides a way for attackers too if left misconfigured.

->Same-origin policy

The same-origin policy is a restrictive cross-origin specification that limits the ability for a website to interact with resources outside of the source domain. The same-origin policy was defined many years ago in response to potentially malicious cross-domain interactions, such as one website stealing private data from another. It generally allows a domain to issue requests to other domains, but not to access the responses.
