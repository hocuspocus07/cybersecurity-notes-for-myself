DevSecOps is a culture that consists of guidelines, best practices, and tools that development, operation, and security teams use to collaborate.
DevSecOps has become an integral part of the software development lifecycle.

->SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFECYCLE:

The software development lifecycle is a process for developing, testing, and monitoring software.
In my words:
Planning: kya banana hai, kyun banana hai

Design: kaise banana hai

Development: code likh lo bhidu

Testing: dekh lo kuch uda toh nahi

Deployment: production me daal do

Maintenance: bugs, updates, user ke rona-dhona handle karo

 1.
 Plan
 2. Code
 3. Build
4. Test
 5. Release
 6. Deploy
 7. Operate

->SHIFT LEFT:
DevSecOps culture also reinforces the security concept of shifting left.
To shift left means security checks and practices are implemented at the beginning and throughout each phase of the software development lifecycle.

Shifting left with security involves a variety of shifting left practices that might include:
code analysis, 
change and compliance management,
 threat modeling,
  and security training.
