Serverless computing is a cloud computing model where servers are abstracted from
 development. Despite the name serverless, this computing model does involve servers. The
 servers and resources are completely managed by the cloud service provider (CSP). This
 alows developers to focus on creating and deploying code without worrying about backend
 infrastructure.

Backend as a Service(Baas):
 BaaS is a form of serverless computing where the CSP manages al aspects of the backend
 infrastructure. This includes servers, containers, and virtual machines. Developers use BaaS to
 speed the creation of web applications. With BaaS, developers can focus on writing the front
 end code, which is the code that builds the user interface. Organizations have access to other
 services, like databases, le storage, and authentication services that can be native or third
 party to the platform

Function as a Service(Faas):
 FaaS is a form of serverless computing that runs functions. A function is a smal piece of code.
 Functions are ephemeral, meaning they only exist for a short period of time. Developers can
 use their choice of programming language to create functions, which makes adopting
 serverless computing more convenient
