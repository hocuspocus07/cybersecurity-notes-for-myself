->structured:
 data organized in a certain format, like rows and columns.

->Unstructured data:
data that is not organized in any easily identifiable way.

->STORAGE TYPES:
1.file:
File storage uses a hierarchy of files in folders.
It keeps data in one place and organizes it in a simple, easy-to-understand way. File storage is ideal for smaller volumes of data that a few people might need access to, like files on a family computer. Each file starts at the home directory, then users can navigate to what they need by following a logical path.
File storage is the oldest and most widely used data storage system, but it has some limitations and can only handle so much.
2. Object:
Object storage holds unstructured data in something called a bucket.
A bucket is a virtual container that holds objects. Each bucket is assigned a unique name. These buckets can be public, meaning that anyone can access the objects inside, or private, so only certain people have access.
3. Blocks:
data is split into smaller blocks, each stored in different locations to maximize efficiency.
Each block is given a unique ID, and when users ask to retrieve their data, the smaller blocks are connected together again based on these IDs.


-> CLASSES FOR DATA STORAGE:
1. Standard:
Used for hot data, this is used for data that is frequently used and retrieval is in milliseconds.

2. Nearline:
Best for data which is used once a month. Most cost effective, good option for backup of data.

3. Coldline:
Data accessed once in 90 days or once in a quarter.
 Coldline storage is very cost effective because the data being stored is at rest
 for long periods of time.

4. Archival:
 archival storage is best for archiving or backing up data for disaster recovery purposes.
 This includes data that is accessed very infrequently, or once a year. Since thereâ€™s not as high
 of a demand for availability, archival storage is also very cost-e ective
