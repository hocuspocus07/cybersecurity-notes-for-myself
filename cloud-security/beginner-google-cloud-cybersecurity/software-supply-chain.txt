The software supply chain includes the people, processes, and tools that play a part in software development.
This includes code scripts, people and organizations, third-party dependencies, processes, and more.

->SECURITY HARDENING:
Security hardening is the process of strengthening a system to reduce its vulnerabilities and attack surface.

->SBOM:
Another method is to use a software bill of materials, or SBOM, to address security measures and compliance.
An SBOM is a machine-readable list of each piece of software and its components involved in the supply chain.

->SLSA:
Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts.
SLSA improves security by outlining standards and controls that enhance the integrity of artifacts.

SLSA’s framework revolves around three trust boundaries: build integrity, source integrity, and dependencies.
Level 0: Bas source code copy hua, build process unchecked — matlab khula khazana.

Level 1: Build process reproducible hai — matlab agar tu code dobara build karega, same output milega.

Level 2: Build process fully defined aur auditable — matlab har step check ho sakta.

Level 3: Provenance aur integrity check complete — matlab tu sure ho ke ye build clean hai, tampered nahi.

SLSA recommends incorporating technical controls such as version control, vulnerability scanning, build verification, deployment policies, and artifact management.
